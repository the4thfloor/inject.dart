# This file configures the static analysis results for your project (errors,
# warnings, and lints).
#
# This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.
#
# If you want a smaller set of lints you can change this to specify
# 'package:lints/core.yaml'. These are just the most critical lints
# (the recommended set includes the core lints).
# The core lints are also what is used by pub.dev for scoring packages.

# Uncomment the following section to specify additional rules.

linter:
  rules:
    - always_declare_return_types # Declare method return types.
    - always_put_control_body_on_new_line # Separate the control structure expression from its statement.
    - avoid_types_on_closure_parameters # Avoid annotating types for function expression parameters.
    - avoid_unused_constructor_parameters # Avoid defining unused parameters in constructors.
    - cascade_invocations # Cascade consecutive method invocations on the same reference.
    - combinators_ordering # Sort combinator names alphabetically.
    - comment_references # Only reference in scope identifiers in doc comments.
    - directives_ordering # Adhere to Effective Dart Guide directives sorting conventions.
    - discarded_futures # Don’t invoke asynchronous functions in non-async blocks.
    - eol_at_end_of_file # Put a single newline at end of file.
    - matching_super_parameters # Use matching super parameter names.
    - omit_local_variable_types # Omit type annotations for local variables.
    - prefer_const_constructors # Prefer const with constant constructors.
    - prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables # Prefer declaring const constructors on @immutable classes.
    - prefer_const_declarations # Prefer const over final for declarations.
    - prefer_expression_function_bodies # Use => for short members whose body is a single return statement.
    - prefer_final_in_for_each # Prefer final in for-each loop variable if reference is not reassigned.
    - prefer_final_locals # Prefer final for variable declarations if they are not reassigned.
    - prefer_foreach # Use forEach to only apply a function to all the elements.
    - prefer_int_literals # Prefer int literals over double literals.
    - prefer_null_aware_method_calls # Prefer null aware method calls.
    - prefer_relative_imports # Prefer relative imports for files in lib/.
    - prefer_single_quotes # Only use double quotes for strings containing single quotes.
    - require_trailing_commas # Use trailing commas for all function calls and declarations.
    - test_types_in_equals # Test type arguments in operator ==(Object other).
    - throw_in_finally # Avoid throw in finally block.
    - unawaited_futures # Future results in async function bodies must be awaited or marked unawaited using dart:async.
    - unnecessary_await_in_return # Unnecessary await keyword in return.
    - unnecessary_breaks # Don’t use explicit breaks when a break is implied.
    - unnecessary_lambdas # Don’t create a lambda when a tear-off will do.
    - use_super_parameters # Use super-initializer parameters where possible.
